# Audio_Devices
Here is a repository of code for simple audio devices I have made. 

Here, I will upload various files that exemplify my understanding of how to create the following devices: 

1. A Simple Sound Recorder that outputs .wav files of a specified duration (complete)
2. A Dynamic Compressor that can be used as an audio device  (VST? Still thinking about this) 
3. Reaper or Pro Tools Automation Tool

Stay tuned for some exciting learning and the description of what I have made. 
Thanks!
